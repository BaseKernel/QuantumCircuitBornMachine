## Setup Guide
Set up your python environment

* python 3.6
* install python libraries

If you want to read notebooks only and do not want to use features like [`projectq`](https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ), having `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` is enough.
To access advanced features, you should install `fire`, `projectq` and `climin`.
```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge pybind11
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Bar-and-Stripes Demo on Your Localhost

```bash
$ ./program.py checkgrad  # check the correctness of gradient
$ ./program.py statgrad  # check gradient will not vanish as layer index increase.
$ ./program.py vcircuit  # visualize circuit using ProjectQ
$ ./program.py train   # train and save data.
$ ./program.py vpdf   # see bar stripe dataset PDF
$ ./program.py generate  # generate bar and stripes using trainned circuit.
```
